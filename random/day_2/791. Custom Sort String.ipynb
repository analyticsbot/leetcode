    "\n",
    "You are given two strings `order` and `s`. All the characters of `order` are unique and were sorted in some custom order previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Permute the characters of `s` so that they match the order that `order` was sorted. More specifically, if a character `x` occurs before a character `y` in `order`, then `x` should occur before `y` in the permuted string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return any permutation of `s` that satisfies this property.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**  \n",
    "`order = \"cba\", s = \"abcd\"`  \n",
    "**Output:**  \n",
    "`\"cbad\"`  \n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "\"c\", \"b\", \"a\" appear in order, so the order of \"a\", \"b\", \"c\" should be \"c\", \"b\", and \"a\".  \n",
    "Since \"d\" does not appear in `order`, it can be at any position in the returned string. \"dcba\", \"cdba\", \"cbda\" are also valid outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**  \n",
    "`order = \"bcafg\", s = \"abcd\"`  \n",
    "**Output:**  \n",
    "`\"bcad\"`  \n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "The characters \"b\", \"c\", and \"a\" from `order` dictate the order for the characters in `s`.  \n",
    "The character \"d\" in `s` does not appear in `order`, so its position is flexible.  \n",
    "Following the order of appearance in `order`, \"b\", \"c\", and \"a\" from `s` should be arranged as \"b\", \"c\", \"a\".  \n",
    "\"d\" can be placed at any position since it's not in `order`. The output `\"bcad\"` correctly follows this rule.  \n",
    "Other arrangements like `\"dbca\"` or `\"bcda\"` would also be valid, as long as \"b\", \"c\", \"a\" maintain their order.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `1 <= order.length <= 26`\n",
    "- `1 <= s.length <= 200`\n",
    "- `order` and `s` consist of lowercase English letters.\n",
    "- All the characters of `order` are unique.\n"
