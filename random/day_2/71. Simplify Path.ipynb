    "You are given an absolute path for a Unix-style file system, which always begins with a slash `/`. Your task is to transform this absolute path into its simplified canonical path.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules of a Unix-style file system are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A single period `.` represents the current directory.\n",
    "- A double period `..` represents the previous/parent directory.\n",
    "- Multiple consecutive slashes such as `//` and `///` are treated as a single slash `/`.\n",
    "- Any sequence of periods that does not match the rules above should be treated as a valid directory or file name. For example, `...` and `....` are valid directory or file names.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplified canonical path should follow these rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The path must start with a single slash `/`.\n",
    "- Directories within the path must be separated by exactly one slash `/`.\n",
    "- The path must not end with a slash `/`, unless it is the root directory.\n",
    "- The path must not have any single or double periods (`.` and `..`) used to denote current or parent directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the simplified canonical path.\n",

    "**Explanation:**  \n",

    "**Output:**  \n",
    "`\"/home/user/Pictures\"`  \n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "A double period `..` refers to the directory up a level (the parent directory).\n",
