    "## Problem Description\n",
    "Given an array of strings `words` and a width `maxWidth`, format the text such that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters and is fully (left and right) justified. You should pack your words in a **greedy approach**; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces `' '` when necessary so that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters. Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right. For the last line of text: it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes:\n",
    "1. A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.\n",
    "2. Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed `maxWidth`.\n",
    "3. The input array `words` contains at least one word.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**  \n",
    "**Input:**  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "words = [\"This\", \"is\", \"an\", \"example\", \"of\", \"text\", \"justification.\"]\n",
    "maxWidth = 16\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output\n",
    "```\n",
    "[\n",
    "   \"This    is    an\",\n",
    "   \"example  of text\",\n",
    "   \"justification.  \"\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Input2\n",
    "```\n",
    "words = [\"What\",\"must\",\"be\",\"acknowledgment\",\"shall\",\"be\"]\n",
    "maxWidth = 16\n",
    "```\n",
    "Output\n",
    "```\n",
    "[\n",
    "  \"What   must   be\",\n",
    "  \"acknowledgment  \",\n",
    "  \"shall be        \"\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: Note that the last line is \"shall be \" instead of \"shall be\", because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified. The second line is also left-justified because it contains only one word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 3:\n",
    "Input:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "words = [\"Science\",\"is\",\"what\",\"we\",\"understand\",\"well\",\"enough\",\"to\",\"explain\",\"to\",\"a\",\"computer.\",\"Art\",\"is\",\"everything\",\"else\",\"we\",\"do\"]\n",
    "maxWidth = 20\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output\n",
    "```\n",
    "[\n",
    "  \"Science  is  what we\",\n",
    "  \"understand      well\",\n",
