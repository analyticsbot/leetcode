    "#### Problem\n",
    "You have been tasked with writing a program for a popular bank that will automate all its incoming transactions (transfer, deposit, and withdraw). The bank has `n` accounts numbered from `1` to `n`. The initial balance of each account is stored in a 0-indexed integer array `balance`, with the `(i + 1)`th account having an initial balance of `balance[i]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Execute all the valid transactions. A transaction is valid if:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The given account number(s) are between `1` and `n`, and\n",
    "2. The amount of money withdrawn or transferred from is less than or equal to the balance of the account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the `Bank` class:\n",
    "- `Bank(long[] balance)`: Initializes the object with the 0-indexed integer array `balance`.\n",
    "- `boolean transfer(int account1, int account2, long money)`: Transfers `money` dollars from the account numbered `account1` to the account numbered `account2`. Return `true` if the transaction was successful, `false` otherwise.\n",
    "- `boolean deposit(int account, long money)`: Deposit `money` dollars into the account numbered `account`. Return `true` if the transaction was successful, `false` otherwise.\n",
    "- `boolean withdraw(int account, long money)`: Withdraw `money` dollars from the account numbered `account`. Return `true` if the transaction was successful, `false` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[\"Bank\", \"withdraw\", \"transfer\", \"deposit\", \"transfer\", \"withdraw\"]\n",
    "[[[10, 100, 20, 50, 30]], [3, 10], [5, 1, 20], [5, 20], [3, 4, 15], [10, 50]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[null, true, true, true, false, false]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "Bank bank = new Bank([10, 100, 20, 50, 30]);\n",
    "bank.withdraw(3, 10);    // return true, account 3 has a balance of $20, so it is valid to withdraw $10.\n",
    "                         // Account 3 has $20 - $10 = $10.\n",
    "bank.transfer(5, 1, 20); // return true, account 5 has a balance of $30, so it is valid to transfer $20.\n",
    "                         // Account 5 has $30 - $20 = $10, and account 1 has $10 + $20 = $30.\n",
    "bank.deposit(5, 20);     // return true, it is valid to deposit $20 to account 5.\n",
    "                         // Account 5 has $10 + $20 = $30.\n",
    "bank.transfer(3, 4, 15); // return false, the current balance of account 3 is $10,\n",
    "                         // so it is invalid to transfer $15 from it.\n",
    "bank.withdraw(10, 50);   // return false, it is invalid because account 10 does not exist.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "- n == balance.length\n",
    "- 1 <= n, account, account1, account2 <= 10^5\n",
    "- 0 <= balance[i], money <= 10^12\n",
    "- At most 10^4 calls will be made to each function transfer, deposit, withdraw.\n",
