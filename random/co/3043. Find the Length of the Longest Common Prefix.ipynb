    "You are given two arrays with positive integers arr1 and arr2.\n",
    "\n",
    "A prefix of a positive integer is an integer formed by one or more of its digits, starting from its leftmost digit. For example, 123 is a prefix of the integer 12345, while 234 is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common prefix of two integers a and b is an integer c, such that c is a prefix of both a and b. For example, 5655359 and 56554 have common prefixes 565 and 5655 while 1223 and 43456 do not have a common prefix.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to find the length of the longest common prefix between all pairs of integers (x, y) such that x belongs to arr1 and y belongs to arr2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the length of the longest common prefix among all pairs. If no common prefix exists among them, return 0.\n",

    "\n",
    "Input: arr1 = [1,2,3], arr2 = [4,4,4]\n",
    "Output: 0\n",
    "Explanation: There exists no common prefix for any pair (arr1[i], arr2[j]), hence we return 0.\n",
