    "1. **Counting Characters**: For each string in the input list `strs`, the `Counter` class counts the frequency of each character.\n",
    "2. **Creating Keys**: The items of the `Counter` are converted into a `frozenset`, which serves as a hashable key that represents the character count of the string. This allows different strings with the same character counts (anagrams) to be grouped together.\n",
    "3. **Grouping Anagrams**: Each string is appended to a list in a dictionary where the keys are the `frozensets`. As a result, all anagrams will be stored in the same list under the same key.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity\n",
    "- **O(n * k)**, where:\n",
    "  - **n** is the number of strings in `strs`.\n",
    "  - **k** is the maximum length of a string in `strs`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "The reason is that for each string, we perform a linear scan to count the characters (O(k)), and this operation is done for all n strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity\n",
    "- **O(n * k)** in the worst case:\n",
    "  - The space is required to store the lists of grouped anagrams and the `Counter` objects.\n",
    "  - In the case where all strings are anagrams of each other, we would store all of them in a single list.\n"
