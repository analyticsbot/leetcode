    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize Variables**:\n",
    "   - `m` and `n` are set as the lengths of `nums1` and `nums2`, respectively.\n",
    "   - If `nums1` is larger than `nums2`, we swap them. This ensures that `nums1` is the smaller array, making the binary search efficient and preventing out-of-bound issues when dividing indices. An out-of-bound issue occurs when an index points outside the valid range of an array, causing an error. Here, it means accessing elements beyond the start or end of an array during binary search, which can lead to invalid memory access or runtime exceptions. Ensuring nums1 is the smaller array minimizes this risk by keeping partition indices within valid bounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Edge Case**:\n",
    "   - If both arrays are empty, return `0.0` since there are no elements to find a median.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Binary Search Setup**:\n",
    "   - We use binary search on the smaller array (`nums1`), initializing `start` to `0` and `end` to `m` (the length of `nums1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Binary Search Loop**:\n",
    "   - While `start <= end`, calculate:\n",
    "     - `partition1`, the partition index for `nums1`.\n",
    "     - `partition2`, the partition index for `nums2` calculated based on `partition1` so that the left half contains exactly half of the total elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Partition Edge Cases**:\n",
    "   - `maxLeft1` and `minRight1` represent the maximum element on the left of `partition1` and the minimum element on the right, respectively.\n",
    "   - `maxLeft2` and `minRight2` represent the maximum and minimum elements around `partition2` in `nums2`.\n",
    "   - If a partition index is out of bounds (i.e., no element exists on one side), we set the boundary to `float('-inf')` or `float('inf')` to ensure comparisons don’t fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Check Partitions**:\n",
    "   - **Correct Partition**: If `maxLeft1 <= minRight2` and `maxLeft2 <= minRight1`, we have correctly partitioned the arrays:\n",
    "     - If the total number of elements (`m + n`) is even, the median is the average of the maximum left value and minimum right value:\n",
    "       \\[\n",
    "       \\text{median} = \\frac{\\max(\\text{maxLeft1}, \\text{maxLeft2}) + \\min(\\text{minRight1}, \\text{minRight2})}{2.0}\n",
    "       \\]\n",
    "     - If the total number is odd, the median is the maximum of the left values:\n",
    "       \\[\n",
    "       \\text{median} = \\max(\\text{maxLeft1}, \\text{maxLeft2})\n",
    "       \\]\n",
    "   - **Adjust Search Range**:\n",
    "     - If `maxLeft1 > minRight2`, we are too far right in `nums1`, so we move `end` to `partition1 - 1`.\n",
    "     - If `maxLeft2 > minRight1`, we are too far left in `nums1`, so we move `start` to `partition1 + 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Exception Handling**:\n",
    "   - If no valid partition is found (which should not happen if input arrays are sorted), raise a `ValueError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: \\(O(\\log \\min(m, n))\\) due to binary search on the smaller array.\n",
