    "##### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Initialization:\n",
    "- **`min_price`**: Tracks the smallest price seen so far.\n",
    "- **`max_profit`**: Tracks the maximum profit that can be achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Iteration:\n",
    "- For each price in the list:\n",
    "  - Update `min_price` to the smaller value between the current `min_price` and the current price.\n",
    "  - Calculate the potential profit if the stock were sold at the current price.\n",
    "  - Update `max_profit` to the larger value between the current `max_profit` and the potential profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Result:\n",
    "- After iterating through all prices, `max_profit` contains the maximum possible profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input**:  \n",

    "**Execution**:\n",

    "- Day 2: `min_price = 1`, `max_profit = 0`\n",
    "- Day 3: `min_price = 1`, `max_profit = 4` (sell at 5, buy at 1)\n",
    "- Day 4: `min_price = 1`, `max_profit = 4`\n",
    "- Day 5: `min_price = 1`, `max_profit = 5` (sell at 6, buy at 1)\n",
    "- Day 6: `min_price = 1`, `max_profit = 5`\n",
