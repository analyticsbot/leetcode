    "##### Explanation of the Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Initialization:\n",
    "- **`t_count`**: A Counter to store the frequency of characters in the string `t`.\n",
    "- **`current_count`**: A dictionary to track the frequency of characters in the current sliding window of `s`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "##### Pointers:\n",
    "- **`start`**: Left boundary of the sliding window.\n",
    "- **`end`**: Right boundary of the sliding window (tracked via the loop).\n",
    "  \n",
    "##### Variables:\n",
    "- **`min_length`**: Stores the length of the smallest valid window found.\n",
    "- **`min_window`**: Stores the actual substring of the smallest valid window.\n",
    "- **`required`**: The number of unique characters in `t` (from `t_count`).\n",
    "- **`formed`**: Tracks how many unique characters in `t` are fully formed in the current window.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Sliding Window:\n",
    "- Expand the window by moving the `end` pointer and updating `current_count`.\n",
    "- If a character in the window satisfies the frequency needed by `t` (i.e., matches `t_count`), increment `formed`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Window Validation and Contraction:\n",
    "- When `formed == required`, it means the current window contains all characters of `t` in the required frequencies.\n",
    "- Check if the current window size is smaller than `min_length`, and if so, update `min_length` and `min_window`.\n",
    "- Shrink the window by moving the `start` pointer, updating `current_count`, and decrementing `formed` if the character removed invalidates the window.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Result:\n",
    "- After iterating through `s`, return `min_window`. If no valid window is found, return an empty string.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Time Complexity:\n",
    "- **O(n + m)**:\n",
    "  - `n` is the length of `s`.\n",
    "  - `m` is the length of `t`.\n",
    "  - Each character is added and removed from the window at most once.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Space Complexity:\n",
    "- **O(m)**:\n",
    "  - `t_count` and `current_count` require space proportional to the size of `t`.\n"
